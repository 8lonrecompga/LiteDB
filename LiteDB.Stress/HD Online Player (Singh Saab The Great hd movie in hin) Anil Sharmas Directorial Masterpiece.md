This dialogue is delivered by Sunny Deol in his trademark style and shows his strength and confidence. Another dialogue that resonates with the theme of the movie is "Jab tak sarkar ki kursi par baithne wale logon ko yeh samajh mein nahi aata ki woh kursi unke liye nahi hai, woh kursi unke liye hai jo kursi par baithne ke layak nahi hai" (Until the people who sit on the government chair understand that the chair is not for them, the chair is for those who are not worthy of sitting on it). This dialogue is said by Amrita Rao, who plays a journalist and Singh Saab's love interest in the movie. She expresses her frustration with the system and the need for change.
 
The movie also has some thrilling action sequences that showcase Sunny Deol's prowess as an action hero. One of the most impressive scenes is when Singh Saab escapes from jail and confronts Bhoodev Singh in his mansion.

He also uses his signature hand pump as a weapon and throws it at Bhoodev Singh's helicopter, causing it to crash. The scene is full of drama and adrenaline and leaves the audience cheering for Singh Saab.
